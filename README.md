## Project Overview<a id="project"></a>

The data set contains three files, which are simulated on the Starbucks rewards mobile app, which focuses on the customers' transactions behavior. Our topic targets are that how the effect of the reward offer is and is there a relationship between the reward offer and the users' demographic information. From the company side, it is interesting that whether the customers are more willing to pay more money in the Starbucks after the promotion.

When we analyze the users' willing, we use the amount as the target label and the users' demographic information and the promotion type as explanatory variables. Of course, the target label is continuous value, we consider that the Supervised learning is a right way to build model.
